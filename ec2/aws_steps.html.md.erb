This tutorial guides users who have minimal experience with Cloud Foundry 
deployments through deploying a test environment that runs on Amazon Web 
Services (AWS) EC2.

In addition to configuring AWS components for Cloud Foundry, you must set up 
four Cloud Foundry components. 
This involves preparing two deployment manifest YAML files, one for MicroBOSH 
and one for Cloud Foundry, and uploading both a MicroBOSH stemcell and a Cloud 
Foundry release package. 
We describe these components in detail as you proceed through this tutorial.

##Installing MicroBOSH and Cloud Foundry on AWS ##

MicroBOSH on AWS:
