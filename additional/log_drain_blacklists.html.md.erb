<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

The `doppler` component allows application log drains. An application developer
deploying their app to Cloud Foundry can bind a drain to a log analysis service.

The performance of your Cloud Foundry installation can be affected if the application developer attempts to bind a drain to an internal Cloud Foundry component.

To prevent this event, blacklist the range of IP addresses that apps can use for binding drains.

To blacklist an IP address range, add the `doppler.blacklisted_syslog_ranges`
property to your stub, or create an additional stub. Specify starting and
ending IP addresses for each IP address range.

Example stub:

```

properties:
  doppler:
    blacklisted_syslog_ranges:
    - start: 10.10.16.0
      end: 10.10.31.255
    - start: 10.10.80.0
      end: 10.10.95.255
```
