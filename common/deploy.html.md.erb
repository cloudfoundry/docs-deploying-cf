<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

This topic describes the process for deploying Cloud Foundry using BOSH. It
assumes you have already targeted your BOSH Director, created a Cloud Foundry manifest, and
set it as your deployment.

##<a id="stemcell"></a>Upload a Stemcell ##

A stemcell is a versioned image of a bare-minimum OS skeleton, wrapped with IaaS-specific packaging. Deploying Cloud Foundry starts with specifying a stemcell, which BOSH installs on each component VM.

1. Open [https://bosh.io/stemcells](https://bosh.io/stemcells) in a web browser
to view the current list of publicly available BOSH stemcells.

1. Choose a BOSH stemcell for your IaaS and **click** the build number to download it to your computer. It downloads as a gzipped tar archive which you should not unzip.

1. In a terminal window, run `bosh upload stemcell STEMCELL-PATH` to upload your
stemcell to the BOSH Director, where `STEMCELL-PATH` is the location of your downloaded stemcell file.
<pre class="terminal">
bosh upload stemcell ~/downloads/light-bosh-stemcell-3202-aws-xen-hvm-ubuntu-trusty-go_agent.tgz
</pre>

##<a id="create-release"></a>Build the Cloud Foundry Release##

1. Use `bosh create release` to create a Cloud Foundry release.
After some processing, this command prompts you for a development release name. The release names correspond to the files in `cf-release/releases`.

##<a id="upload-release"></a>Upload the Cloud Foundry Release##

Use `bosh upload release` to upload the generated release to the BOSH
Director.

<pre class="terminal">
$ bosh upload release
</pre>

##<a id="deploy"></a>Deploy!##

Use `bosh deploy` to deploy the uploaded Cloud Foundry release.

<pre class="terminal">
$ bosh deploy
</pre>

## <a id="verify"></a>Verify the Deployment ##

1. Run `bosh vms`. This command provides an overview of the virtual machines
that BOSH manages as part of the current deployment. The state of every VM
should show as **running**.

    <pre class="terminal">
    $ bosh vms

1. Use `curl` to test the API endpoint of your Cloud Foundry installation at `api.YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN/info`.

    <pre class="terminal">
    $ curl api.INCORRECT-SYSTEM-DOMAIN/info
    404 Not Found: Requested route ('api.INCORRECT-SYSTEM-DOMAIN.com') does not exist.

    $ curl api.YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN
    {
     "code": 10000,
     "description": "Unknown request",
     "error_code": "CF-NotFound"
    }

    $ curl api.YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN/info
    {"name":"vcap","build":"2222","version":2,"description":"Cloud Foundry","authorization_endpoint":"https://login.YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN","token_endpoint":"https://uaa.YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN","allow_debug":true}
    </pre>

    If `curl` succeeds, it should return specific JSON-formatted information about your deployment. If `curl` does not succeed, check your networking and make sure your domain
  	has an NS record for your subdomain.

1. You should be able to target your Cloud Foundry installation with the [cf Command Line Interface (CLI)](../../cf-cli/index.html) and log in as an administrator. The username is `admin` and the password is specified in the deployment manifest:

    ```
    properties:
      ...
      uaa:
        ...
        scim:
          ...
          users:
          - admin|ADMIN_PASSWORD|...
    ```

For more information about managing organizations, spaces, users, and applications, refer to the [cf CLI](../../cf-cli/index.html) topic.

##<a id="update-cf"></a>Update Cloud Foundry##

* If you make change to your manifest, run `bosh deploy` to update your Cloud
Foundry deployment with these changes.

* If you make changes to the `cf-release` directory, run the following commands to update your Cloud Foundry deployment with these changes:
<pre class="terminal">
  $ bosh create release && bosh upload release && bosh deploy
</pre>
