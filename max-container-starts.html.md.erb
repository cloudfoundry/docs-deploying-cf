title: Setting a Maximum Number of Instance Starts
owner: Diego
---



Use the auctioneer component to set the maximum number of app instances running at a given time. A lower default can prevent server overload, which may be important if you're using a small server. If you're using a cloud-based IaaS, rather than a smaller on-premise solution, Cloud Foundry recommends leaving the default at 0.

The auctioneer only schedules a fixed number of app instances to start at one time. This limit applies to both single and multiple Diego Cells. For example, if you set the limit to five started instances, it does not matter if you have one Diego Cell with ten instances or five Diego Cells with two instances each. The auctioneer will not allow more than five instances to start at the same time.

You can configure the maximum number of started instances by changing the `diego.auctioneer.starting_container_count_maximum` property in the Diego manifest.

<ol>
<li>Open the Diego manifest in a text editor.</li>
<li>Find the <pre>diego.auctioneer.starting_container_count_maximum</pre> property.</li>
<li>Type the maximum number of instances the auctioneer should allow to start.</li>
<li>Save the changes and redeploy BOSH.</li>
</ol>
