title: Migrating from cf-release to cf-deployment
owner: Release Integration

<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

This topic describes how to migrate your Cloud Foundry deployment
from `cf-release` to `cf-deployment`.
The procedures in this topic are specific to Amazon Web Services (AWS).
While transitions on other IaaSes are possible,
they are not currently supported.

## <a id='prerequisites'></a> Prerequisites

Complete the following steps before performing the procedures in this topic:

* Install the BOSH CLI v2.
For more information, see the <a href="https://bosh.io/docs/cli-v2.html#install">BOSH documentation</a>.
* Review the migration prerequisites in the [cf-deployment-transition](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-deployment-transition/blob/master/README.md#migration-prerequisites) GitHub repo,
with particular attention to the following:
  - You must enable all TLS features.
  - You must be using external databases.
  - You must be using an external blobstore.
  - You must either create additional databases
    or disable some optional features in `cf-deployment`.
* Review the following prerequisites to ensure your deployed network configuration
  is compatible with the transition process:
  - You must have sufficient available addresses
    in your Cloud Foundry network
    to fit the scale of your Diego deployment.
    Diego jobs will be deployed to your Cloud Foundry network
    as part of the transition.
  - You must have non-overlapping network IP address ranges
    in your existing deployments.
    <br><br>
    When you deploy `cf-deployment` with your new [cloud config](https://bosh.io/docs/cloud-config.html),
    the BOSH Director treats the entire range
    of any networks declared in your Diego manifest
    as fully used.
    If you previously had networks with
    fully overlapping IP address ranges
    that had one another's ranges as `reserved`
    to avoid conflicts,
    the BOSH Director cannot assign IP addresses
    in any of those networks.
    <br><br>
    To resolve this problem,
    redefine your networks so that they don't overlap,
    and deploy those changes
    prior to starting the transition process.

## <a id='configure-cli'></a> Step 1: Configure the BOSH CLI v2
Perform the following steps:

1. Set your BOSH Director address, username, and password as environment variables:
  <pre class="terminal">
  $ export BOSH\_ENVIRONMENT=YOUR-DIRECTOR-ADDRESS
  $ export BOSH\_CLIENT=YOUR-DIRECTOR-USERNAME
  $ export BOSH\_CLIENT\_SECRET=YOUR-DIRECTOR-PASSWORD
  </pre>

1. Confirm that your BOSH CLI is logged in and working:
  <pre class="terminal">
  $ bosh deployments
  Using environment 'bosh.example.com' as client 'admin'
  <br>
  Name      Release(s)            Stemcell(s)                                      Team(s)  Cloud Config
  cf        cf/268                bosh-aws-xen-hvm-ubuntu-trusty-go\_agent/3421.11  -        none
  cf-diego  garden-runc/1.9.0     bosh-aws-xen-hvm-ubuntu-trusty-go\_agent/3421.11  -        none
              grootfs/0.21.0
              cf-networking/1.2.0
              cflinuxfs2/1.138.0
              diego/1.23.0
              cf/268
  </pre>

1. Set your Cloud Foundry deployment name as an environment variable:
  <pre class="terminal">
  $ export BOSH\_DEPLOYMENT=YOUR-CF-DEPLOYMENT-NAME
  </pre>

1. If your BOSH Director is configured with a self-signed certificate,
perform the following steps to provide that certificate to the BOSH CLI.
  1. Extract the necessary certificate
  from your BOSH Director deployment manifest:
  <pre class="terminal">
  $ bosh interpolate \
  --path=/properties/director/ssl/cert PATH-TO-YOUR-BOSH-DIRECTOR-MANIFEST > /tmp/bosh-CA.crt
  </pre>
  1. Configure the BOSH CLI to use the extracted certificate:
  <pre class="terminal">
  $ export BOSH\_CA\_CERT=/tmp/bosh-CA.crt
  </pre>

## <a id='var-store-file'></a> Step 2: Build Variables Store File
You must build a variables store file from your Cloud Foundry and Diego manifests.

This file contains information that provides environment-specific or sensitive configuration
that the BOSH CLI reads and writes to. The operator uses this file when deploying Cloud Foundry
with `cf-deployment`.

Perform the following steps to build your variables store file:

1. Download your Cloud Foundry and Diego manifests from your existing `cf-release`-based deployments:
  <pre class="terminal">
  $ bosh download-manifest > /tmp/cf-manifest.yml
  $ bosh download-manifest -d YOUR-DIEGO-DEPLOYMENT-NAME > /tmp/diego-manifest.yml
  </pre>
1. Visit the [cf-deployment-transition](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-deployment-transition/blob/master/README.md) GitHub repo
   and use the `extract-vars-store-from-manifests.sh` script
   to generate `deployment-vars.yml`.

## <a id='scale'></a> Step 3: Write Scaling Ops File

To perform a successful migration, you must ensure that your `cf-deployment` manifest
deploys components at a scale equivalent to your existing Cloud Foundry and Diego deployments.

### <a id='understand-name-changes'></a> Understand Name Changes
`cf-deployment` renames or combines some jobs in `cf-release`-based manifests.

`cf-release` had a copy of each job for each Availability Zone (AZ),
because historically,
BOSH was unaware of AZs.

`cf-deployment` no longer needs this workaround
thanks to first-class support of AZs in BOSH.
This means that several instance groups have been combined,
which has implications for scaling.

For instance, the `diego-cell` instance group replaces
both the `cell_z1` and the `cell_z2` instance groups
in your existing Diego deployment.
If you currently have 6 instances each of `cell_z1` and `cell_z2`,
you will need 12 instances of `diego-cell`,
which is configured to use both AZ1 and AZ2.
The BOSH Director will automatically
balance these instances between the AZs.

For a list of all job name changes from `cf-release`,
see the `cfr-to-cfd.yml` ops file
in the [cf-deployment-transition](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-deployment-transition/blob/master/cfr-to-cfd.yml) GitHub repo.
This file does not list name changes from the Diego deployment.
However, the only job from the Diego deployment that you must scale is `diego-cells`.

### <a id='write-ops-file'></a> Write Ops File

To scale the components in `cf-deployment`, write an ops file.
An ops file is a YAML file that specifies operations to perform on the deployment manifest,
which you provide to the BOSH CLI when deploying Cloud Foundry in the following section.

The following example ops file scales to 12 instances of the `diego-cell`:

```yaml
---
- type: replace
  path: /instance_groups/name=diego-cell/instances
  value: 12
```

## <a id='cloud-config'></a> Step 4: Write and Upload Cloud Config

You must write a cloud config to provide certain properties for `cf-deployment`, and upload it to your BOSH Director.

Perform the following steps:

1. Write a cloud config, drawing its values from your current Cloud Foundry and Diego manifests. Use the following example as the basis for your cloud config:

    ```yaml
    compilation:
      az: z1
      network: private
      reuse_compilation_vms: true
      vm_extensions:
      - 100GB_ephemeral_disk

          type: gp2
    - name: cf-router-network-properties

      type: manual
    ```
  <br><br>
  Keep in mind the following about the above example:
  * Unless otherwise noted,
    all values come from the Cloud Foundry manifest.
  * You must include compilation configuration.
  * You must include at least the VM types
    and extensions from the example.
  * You must have a network called `default`.
  * You must configure AZs
    `z1`, `z2`, and `z3`.
  * This example assumes that your network setup
    allows your Elastic Load Balancers (ELBs) to talk to your deployment
    without additional security groups.
    If not, you must add an array of `security_groups`
    to the `cf-router-network-properties` and
    `diego-ssh-proxy-network-properties`
    `vm_extensions`.
1. Upload your cloud config to the BOSH Director:
    <pre class="terminal">
    $ bosh update-cloud-config PATH-TO-YOUR-CLOUD-CONFIG
    </pre>

## <a id='deploy-cf'></a> Step 5: Deploy Cloud Foundry
Perform all the steps in the [Deploying Cloud Foundry](./cf-deployment/deploy-cf.html) topic. Keep in mind the following when deploying Cloud Foundry in [Step 5: Deploy](./cf-deployment/deploy-cf.html#deploy):

* You must apply the ops file for scaling your components that you created in the previous step.
* You must apply the `cfr-to-cfd.yml` ops file.
  Download this ops file from the [cf-deployment-transition](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-deployment-transition/blob/master/cfr-to-cfd.yml) GitHub repo.
  If you are disabling `cf-deployment` features to simplify the transition,
  you must also apply the appropriate ops files from the transition repo.
* The `deployment-vars.yml` file you pass with the `--vars-store` flag must be the variables store file you created above.

## <a id='delete-diego'></a> Step 6: Delete Old Diego Deployment
Delete your Diego deployment by running the following command:

<pre class="terminal">
$ bosh -d YOUR-DIEGO-DEPLOYMENT-NAME delete-deployment
</pre>

This command may take several minutes, because each Diego cell must drain its contents to the new `cf-deployment` cells.

## <a id='cleanup'></a> (Optional) Step 7: Clean Up
To delete any unused releases and stemcells from your BOSH Director,
including `cf-release`, run the following command:

<pre class="terminal">
$ bosh clean-up --all
</pre>
