This topic describes helpful tips to deploy Cloud Foundry on OpenStack.

## Self-signed SSL Certificates
View these two topics to add your self-signed certificates to the OpenStack CPI and to the virtual machines (VMs) deployed with your BOSH Director:

* The BOSH OpenStack CPI uses a [chain of trusted certificates](http://bosh.io/docs/openstack-self-signed-endpoints.html) to validate the certificate of your OpenStack endpoints with a property called <code>ca_cert</code>.
* The BOSH Director adds [chain of trusted certificates](http://bosh.io/docs/trusted-certs.html) to all VMs deployed with that Director with a property called <code>trusted_certs</code>.


## GRE Tunnels
If you are using OpenStack's GRE Tunnel networking, the default MTU of 1500 does not allow machines to properly communicate.  Warden is setup out of the box to use 1500 of MTU. Modify the MTU by changing the configuration file for your Cloud Foundry deployment.  

Change the MTU in your `dea_next` block:

```
dea_next:
  mtu: 1454
```

Use `bosh deploy` to push these changes and then reboot your Warden / DEA VM.
